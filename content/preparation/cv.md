Thi section is a step-by-step guide on how to write a successful CV.

# General tips

### Don't lie!

After passing the interviews, companies will rely on an external **background check** agency (e.g. Hireright, Accurate, etc.) to verify the authenticity of the content.

You will have to insert information from former employers on a portal, and you will have to provide official documentation on everything written in the CV (preferably in English): degree certificate, old employment contracts, old pay stubs, citizenship (residence permit), etc.

It may also happen that they send an e-mail or call your former employers; they won't ask anything in depth, usually it is something along the lines of "_Is it true that *NAME* worked as a *ROLE* from mm/yyyy to mm/yyyy for you?_".

If something is true but it cannot be proved quickly and easily, do not put it on your CV. There will also be a criminal check in which you will have to provide criminal records and pending charges, so keep in mind to have these documents at hand. Some of these, such as the confirmation that you are a university student, or your English grade average may take weeks to retrieve. Even if you get away with it, in the future (e.g. layoff times), they may do a background check on current employees to find grounds for dismissal. Usually investment banks do annual background check on all employees.

### Resume file

Use this file name: firstName_lastName_Resume.pdf (e.g. John_Doe_Resume.pdf).

Use a **readable template**, choose one of the following LaTeX templates to make it easier for the recruiter to read them:

To open them, click on "Open As Template" to start editing in [Overleaf](https://overleaf.com).

Avoid using exotic templates in an attempt to be noticed.

## Content

Your CV content should follow this general order:

1. Relevant personal information
2. Work Experience
3. Education
4. Personal projects
5. Achievements
6. (optional) Current hard and soft skills
7. (optional) Hobbies

## 1) Personal info
Add only:
 - email
 - phone number
 - website
 - github
 - linkedin

Due to discriminations do NOT include:
 - Age, date of birth, or any other references to your age
 - Marital status
 - Nationality
 - Photo: apart from discriminations, many ATS cannot read images, so they will get confused and discard your CV; 88% of CVs are rejected if they include a photo [\[source\]](https://teamstage.io/resume-statistics/)
 - Address: companies generally tend to reject people based on their location; they usually tend to prefer applicants who already live in the same city/country as the company. So if you want to apply for companies in a specific city (egs London) it might be useful add your address to London (even a fake one).
 - Current location unless you need a Visa
 - Social Media: except for carreer like LinkedIn and GitHub)
 - Signature


## 2) Work Experience

Not include a full history of every role you've ever had. Include only the relevant positions-the ones that make you a more impressive candidate.

**Job title:** the job you were actually doing. If the title was "full-stack" but you were actually doing back-end, put Back-End. If the company ask for clarification tell the truth, they will understand.
 - (borderline) If you were an Intern at FAANG leave the title "intern" otherwise take it off.
 - Don’t put that you are self-employed or CEO of your company, because if you are looking for a job that means that you are a bad CEO (you are a crappy worker, boss, you don’t understand business…), so leave the name of the company and that you were an employee.  
Self-employment doesn't signal you know how to work as part of a team or follow directions other people give. You need to re-do your resume and interview talking points to counter this potential narrative.
 - Don’t put career progression unless it’s very fast, just put your last job title.
 - If you have a job gap: change the end date to "current", then when you are at the interview explain why there is a gap, otherwise they don’t even invite you in the interview.

**Info to include:** Tools used, Industry worked in, of users supported (Artists? Accountants? Executives?), Geographic area worked, Size of company, Size of department, Size of team.

For each role, insert **3-4 bullet points** about your accomplishments with the following format: "**_Accomplished X by implementing Y which led to Z_**_"_
Show what you did, how you did it, and what the results were (in numbers, %, …).
 - "_Developed and deployed an ensemble model to mitigate first-party fraud by $2.7M in Q4' 19._"
 - "_improved performance to 10,000 req/s with this technique_"
 - "_I’ve been the engineer working for 6 months on feature X for project Y, that was launched in December 2018. Gross revenues for our company increased by Y% within 1 year from its launch_"

Talk about:
 - **People impact**:
   - NO: "_Coached the team on how to use Jira and how to check a burndown chart._"
   - YES: "_Helped the team achieve a **X% increase in velocity** through the use of the burndown chart and Jira._"
 - **Engineering Impact:**
   - NO: "_Reduced app size by 4.2 MBs_"
   - YES: "_Reduced app size by 4.2 MBs, a previous analysis done on app size correlates this to a 0.4% increase in signups._"
 - **Business Impact:**
   - NO: "_Reduced the number of support tickets_"
   - YES: "_Reduced the number of support tickets by 10% for users in the experiment, resulting in **$2M annualized cost savings**._"

If possible put links that prove those metrics and statements.

Use **ChatGPT** to help you with this. But Be careful! ChatGPT uses a lot of qualitative adjectives to make the sentence look cool, this is bad. Your accomplishment must be MEASURABLE not qualitative.

## 3) Education

Avoid writing beginning dates, as they can be used to infer your age. Should they need this information they can obtain it during the background check.

If you were at the top, indicate the percentage, for example: in the 5% of top best students.

Show leadership by indicating if you chaired any club or initiated something significant (volunteering, charity, etc.)

If you got a scholarship, indicate how much and what was the competition to get it.

Do not put elementary, middle, and high schoo. Low GPAs are better left out.

## 4) Projects
Include your 2 - 4 most significant projects. State what the project was and which languages or technologies it employed.
Including details such as whether the project was an individual or a team project, and whether it was completed for a course or independently. These details are not required, so only include them if they make you look better.
Independent projects are generally preferred over course projects, as it shows initiative.
Include the link to:
 - GitHub repository
 - Live demo
 - Article / Publication
 - Video demo (30 sec)

Put a link on the github repo and on the live demo or video presentation, in interviews they can ask you in depth about the code, make you run it and debug it.
Most recruiters don't know any code make sure to include screenshots in the repo or have your application hosted somewhere like heroku in case they do decide to take a look.

It's important to also put them on [GitHub](https://github.com/) so that people reading your CV can view them.

The name of the project should imply what it does, e.g. "e-commerce for a wine store".

Links to the project should be in the following format: `[code | article | paper | demo | video | presentation]`.

### Publications

If you have publications, list them naming all authors but remember to **highlight your name**.

## 5) Achievements
If you won some hackatons, math olimpiads, or you got a scholarship.  
As many recruiters have very little time to dedicate to your CV and they are also busy with other tasks, they mainly look for **sucessfull, competitive, actionable** and **measurable** achievements.

If possible put **links** that **prove** those metrics and statements.

Example:
 - NO: Playing chess during free time
   - YES: Chess player ranked among [top 1% in 2024 FIDE ratings](https://ratings.fide.com/profile/1503014).
 - NO: Passionated about running and marathons
   - YES: Competed in 41 half-marathons, [European U23 Championships Silver medallist](https://worldathletics.org/athletes/italy/giuseppe-gerratana-14375975)

## 6) Skills

**Software:** Be conservative about what software you list, and understand what's appropriate for the company

**Programming Languages:** List most of the languages you've used with your experience level.
Don’t put the percentage or your level of knowledge, because:
 - is not really required
 - they are searching for key-word
 - let them grade you at the interview (some companies require very basic knowledge other very deep)
 - don’t tell them you are bad in something before you even get there.
 - ATS software get confused with infographics

This is not good: "_Languages: Java (expert), C++ (proficient), JavaScript (prior experience)_"

**Soft skills:** Put them only if you have space left.
The problem with soft skills is that they are very important, but you can’t prove them. And everybody is putting the same ones: team working, leadership, ...


# Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS)

## How do ATS work

ATS collect and store CVs in a database. Sometimes they may also be stored long after the original job you applied for is filled.

Corporate recruiters or hiring managers can then search and sort through the resumes in a number of ways, depending on the system they’re using.

ATS automatically compare your CV to the job description, and then rank each applicant based on how well it scores based on the job description.

Usually recruiters filter resumes by searching for key skills and titles.

## Tools to improve ATS compatibility

 <!-- https://glidecv.com/ is a dead link. -->
You can use [ResumeWorded](https://resumeworded.com/) or [EnhanCV](https://app.enhancv.com) to get a score on how compatible your CV is.

## Optimize your CV for ATS


### Length

Keep your CV long enough to tell your story, under 10 years of experience one page is usually enough.

Don't put anything older than 3/4 years, unless they are valid and relevant experiences.

Writing your CV in LaTeX allows you to add comments to hide parts of the CV that are not interesting and/or relevant to the position.

### Tailor your CV to the job description

Carefully write your CV to match the job description every time you apply, search for matching keywords and requirements and put them in when applicable.



### Acronyms

Use both the long and short version of acronyms (e.g. "Master of Business Administration (MBA)") for maximum searchability.

### Links

Use [Bitly](https://bit.ly/) so you can see who clicked your links and when.

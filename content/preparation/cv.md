One of the most frequently asked questions from people attending our talks is "How can I write my CV"?
During our talks we have repeatedly addressed this topic, in this section we want to summarize all the advice we have been given over time.

Once you have written your CV, don't hesitate to post it on our group [discord group](https://discord.gg/BR2udfnpje) (channel #cv-review) to get suggestions and advices on how to improve it.



# General tips for writing a good Curriculum Vitae
**DON’T LIE:** after the interviews they are going to background check your CV, sometimes they do it also after you are hired. They usually make it done by a third-party company that normally is just going to contact your past employers and ask: "**Has person X worked at company Y as role Z from mm/yyyy to mm/yyyy?**", but sometimes they will also ask to talk for 20 min with your old boss.
So, not only you shouldn’t lie, but also make sure that everything is easy to demonstrate. Only small discrepancies are acceptable.


**How ATS (Applicant Tracking Systems) works:** collect and store resumes in a database. Resumes may also be stored long after the original job you applied for is filled. Corporate recruiters or hiring managers can then search and sort through the resumes in a number of ways, depending on the system they’re using.
Automatically compare your resume to the job description. Ranks each applicant based on how well their resume scores based on the job description.
Usually recruiters filter resumes by searching for key skills and titles.
 - Carefully tailor your resume to the job description every single time
   you apply.
  - Optimize for ATS search and ranking algorithms by
   matching your resume keywords to the job description
  - Use both the long-form and acronym version of keywords (e.g. “Master of Business Administration (MBA)” or “Search Engine Optimization (SEO)”) for  maximum searchability

- Recruiter are looking for: actionable, measurable, accomplishment and achievements.
- Recruiter have very little time, they have to read >100 CVs per hour while doing also other stuff.
- **Length**: Just 1 page non-compulsory. Long enough to tell your story.
- Usually One page if you have less than 10 years of experience.
- Don’t put anything less recent than 3-4 years unless they are valid job experiences.
- **File Name:** firstname_lastname_Resume.pdf
- **Content order**: Info, brief description, skills, Employment history, Education, projects, Hobby
- **Links**: use Bitly so you can look at who clicked on it
- **Must be tailormade for the position:** If resume has too many different things the recruiter manager says no. The resume needs to be clear about what position you are: backend, front or AI....
- Ordered as experience, then skills, then education, because those are the priorities of hiring managers.
- **Write the CV in English**, if you have any doubts about grammar, [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/) and [ChatGPT]([https://www.grammarly.com/](https://chat.openai.com/)) are your friend;
- **Use a readable template**. Choose one of the LaTeX templates we suggest so as to make it easier for the recruiter to read. You will find the template link on [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) in the respective repositories linked below. Click on "Open as Template" to start editing. **Avoid** using exotic templates in an attempt to get noticed.
  #### Suggested Templates
  - [Awesome CV](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/awesome-cv/dfnvtnhzhhbm)
  - [Another Awesome CV](https://github.com/darwiin/yaac-another-awesome-cv)
  - [AltaCV](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/altacv-template/trgqjpwnmtgv)
  - [techResume - Based on AltaCV by Alex Calabrese](https://github.com/alexcalabrese/techResume)

- **Be concise**. The person who is going to read your CV has limited time, so they will spend only a few seconds on it. Your CV should be no longer than a single page, stick to what is really important and include projects and experiences relevant to the position you are applying for. Advantages of writing your CV in LaTeX include the ability to add comments, which are useful for hiding parts of the CV that are not interesting for the position you are applying for and can easily be added back in the future;
- **For each college experience** enter a list of the most relevant courses you have taken, current GPA, and expected final grade (if not too low). If you have already completed your undergraduate degree, enter your final undergraduate grade and the number of credits earned. Add leadership experiences, achievements, and voluntarism: e.g., "_founded crypto-blockchain club_", "_organized competitive programming contests_", "_tutored young students for the algebra course_", ...
- **For each work experience** briefly describe what you did and the impact you had, using the formula "_Accomplished X by implementing Y which led to Z_". For example:
  - “Developed and deployed an ensemble model to mitigate first-party fraud by $2.7M in Q4' 19.”
  - “improved performance to 10,000 req/s with this technique”
  - “I’ve been the engineer working for 6 months on feature X for project Y, that was launched in December 2018. Gross revenues for our company increased by Y% within 1 year from its launch”
- **If you have never worked**, you can list among your experiences projects that you have done during your college courses or that you have done in your spare time. It is important that the projects you list on your CV are also on [GitHub](https://github.com/) so that people reading your CV can view them.
  - The name of the project should imply what it does: e.g. "eCommerce for wine" anzi che "Wine in Milan".
  - Demo videos and project presentations should be very short (1 min).
  - Add links in the following format ```[code | article | paper | demo | video demo | presentation]```
- **If you have publications**, list them naming all other authors but highlight your name;
- **Use action verbs**. example: achieved, completed, expanded, exceeded, improved, pioneered, reduced (losses), resolved (issues), restored, spearheaded, succeeded, surpassed, transformed, won, analyzed, developed, directed, diagnosed, evaluated, examined, built, calculated, Conceptualized, Coded, coached, communicated, conducted, ...
- **Many companies use automated systems for screening CVs**, called *Applicant Tracking System*s (**ATS**). Fortunately there are several services online where you can submit your CV and get a score and advice on what to improve, we point out for example [Resume Worded](https://resumeworded.com/) and [GlideCV](https://glidecv.com/).
- **Content order:** info (email, github, cell, ...), work experience, education, projects, achievements/extra activities

# Mistakes not to be made

- Do not use the Europass template.
- Do not put personal information that can cause any bias/prejudice: pictures, marital status, nationality, etc.
- Don't just list your hard/soft skills, the technologies you know, programming languages etc., but integrate them in the description of the experiences and projects you participated in.
- Always indicate the graduation grade in scale (e.g. 90/110, not just 90), especially if applicating to foreign companies.
- Some American companies/universities may necessarily ask for the grade in [GPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_grading_in_the_United_States). If you have yet to graduate, you can use [this converter](https://applications.wes.org/igpa-calculator/) to obtain your GPA grades starting from the weighted average of the exams you sustained. If you already graduated, it is suggested to use the following formula: (*x* / 20) - 1 where *x* is a percentage (This is because the graduation grade also includes bonus points, outside the weighted average). If your grade is too low, do not enter it.
Examples:
  - 110/110 corresponds to 100%, so (100 / 20) - 1 = 4.0
  - 100/110 corresponds to 90%, so (90 / 20) - 1 = 3.5
- **Do not lie:** after passing the interviews, companies will rely on an external background check agency (e.g. Hireright, Accurate, etc.) to verify the authenticity of the content. You will have to enter information from former employers on a portal, and you will havve to provide official documentation on everything written in the CV (preferably in English): degree certificate, old employment contracts, old pay stubs, citizenship (residence permit), etc. It may also happen that they send an e-mail or call your former employers; they won't ask anything in depth, usually it is something along the lines of "_Is it true that *NAME* worked as a *ROLE* from mm/yyyy to mm/yyyy for you?_". If something is true but it cannot be proved quickly and easily, do not put it on your CV. There will also be a criminal check in which you will have to provide criminal records and pending charges, so keep in mind to have these documents at hand. Some of these, such as the confirmation that you are a university student, or your English grade average may take weeks to retrieve. Even if you get away with it, in the future (e.g. layoff times), they may do a background check on current employees to find grounds for dismissal. Usually investment banks do annual background check on all employees.



# CV sections

### Personal info
Due to discriminations do NOT include:
 - age, date of birth, or references to you age (ageism),
 - marital status
   (if you are married probably you have kids or going to have…),
 -  nationality,
 -  photo (you might remember someone they dislike, or racism),
 -  address: if you live in a poor area of the town that means that you
   are a bad person or that you don’t have transportation, if you live
   in a rich area that means your salary will be very high due to rent
   costs… Or generally they prefer people that already live in the city/country of the company.
 - social media except LinkedIn, Skype and GitHub. current location
   unless you need a VISA
 - signature.

NO PHOTO: because the ATS can’t read the format, get confused and discard your CV.
88% of resumes are rejected if they include a photo.


### Employment History
Not include a full history of every role you've ever had. Include only the relevant positions-the ones that make you a more impressive candidate.

**Job title:** the job you were actually doing. If the title was “full-stack” but you were actually doing back-end, put Back-End. If the company ask for clarification tell the truth, they will understand.

If you Intern at FANG leave in the title “intern” otherwise take it off.

Don’t put that you are self-employed or CEO of your company, because if you are looking for a job that means that you are a bad CEO (you are a crappy worker, boss, you don’t understand business…), so leave the name of the company and that you were an employee.

Self-employment doesn't signal you know how to work as part of a team or follow directions other people give. You need to re-do your resume and interview talking points to counter this potential narrative.

If you have a job gap: change the end date to “current”, then when you are at the interview explain why there is a gap, otherwise they don’t even invite you in the interview.

Don’t put career progression unless it’s very fast, just put your last job title.

Tools used, Industry worked in, of users supported (Artists? Accountants? Executives?), Geographic area worked, Size of company, Size of department, Size of team.

For each role, try to discuss your accomplishments with the following approach: “**_Accomplished X by implementing Y which led to Z_**_”_
Show what you did, how you did it, and what the results were (in numbers, %, …).
 - “Developed and deployed an ensemble model to mitigate first-party fraud by $2.7M in Q4' 19.”
 - “improved performance to 10,000 req/s with this technique”
 - “I’ve been the engineer working for 6 months on feature X for project Y, that was launched in December 2018. Gross revenues for our company increased by Y% within 1 year from its launch”

### Projects
Include your 2 - 4 most significant projects. State what the project was and which languages or technologies it employed.
Including details such as whether the project was an individual or a team project, and whether it was completed for a course or independently. These details are not required, so only include them if they make you look better.
Independent projects are generally preferred over course projects, as it shows initiative.
Include the link to:
 - GitHub repository
 - Live demo
 - Article / Publication
 - Video demo (30 sec)

Put a link on the github repo and on the live demo or video presentation, in interviews they can ask you in depth about the code, make you run it and debug it.
Most recruiters don't know any code make sure to include screenshots in the repo or have your application hosted somewhere like heroku in case they do decide to take a look.


### Skills
Software
Be conservative about what software you list, and understand what's appropriate for the company

Programming Languages
List most of the languages you've used with your experience level.
Don’t put the percentage or your level of knowledge, because:
 - is not really required
 - they are searching for key-word
 - let them grade you at the interview (some companies require very basic knowledge other very deep)
 - don’t tell them you are bad in something before you even get there.
 - ATS software get confused with infographics

This is not good: "_Languages: Java (expert), C++ (proficient), JavaScript (prior experience)_"

### Soft skills
Put them only if you have space left.
The problem with soft skills is that they are very important, but you can’t prove them. And everybody is putting the same ones: team working, leadership, ...


### Education
Avoid to write dates of beginning, because they can infer your age (ageism discriminations), if they really care they will find out in the background check.
If you were at the top, indicate the percentage, for example: in the 5% of top best students
Show leadership by indicating if you chaired any club or initiated something significant (volunteering, charity, etc.)
If you got a scholarship, indicate how much and what was the competition to get it.

NO:
 - elementary, middle, high school
 - low GPA

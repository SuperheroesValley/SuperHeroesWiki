## - To do an internship, is it necessary to travel to the city where the company is located?
During the covid period, internships were conducted online. They are usually held in-person and this is an advantage, in our opinion, because it allows you to have a training experience in all respects.

English proficiency is important. You need to have the ability to interact with the recruiter and interviewer to be able to communicate best during the interview.

## - How important is it to do an internship during college?
Doing an internship provides you with the opportunity to gain practical experience that you usually do not get by doing only your college coursework.
In addition, it is possible that the company, once the internship is over, will contact you again to do the same experience the following year or offer you a contract for a full-time position.

## - I am about to finish my bachelor's degree and will soon start my master's degree, can I apply for an internship even now or is it better to wait for the master's degree?
If you are sure to apply for the master's degree, apply as soon as possible and try to get an internship. 
Remember that the company wants you to return to the university after the work period is over to finish your studies.

## - Is the internship compatible with university? 
Internships can only be done while at university. 
Companies often ask for "permission" from your home university to allow you to do the internship.
